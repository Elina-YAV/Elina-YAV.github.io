<h1>
    A safe place for kids with hidden disabilities to connect, and know they
    aren't alone.
</h1>

<h3>Your future is bright.☀️</h3>

<p>
    At Young Able Voices, children with hidden disabilities will have the
    opportunity to join weekly chats to talk with others facing similar
    challenges that relate to their disabilities. Of course, if you feel a
    little shy, no problem, you can certainly just join the chat and listen in
    as well. When you feel like you would like to share and speak to the group,
    you are always welcome to.
</p>

<p>
    Each week we will have a specific video posted to get the chat rolling. This
    video will be posted a few days prior to each chat and will give you an idea
    of where the conversation will begin. Of course, we never can predict where
    it will end.
</p>

<p>
    Please understand that this is a peer-to-peer support group, and we are all
    just looking to give out helpful suggestions, tips, and tricks in navigating
    daily life as a kid facing challenges. We are not therapists, nor do we
    pretend to be. Rather, we are a peer support group.
</p>

<p>
    Hey Moms, Dads, and all you awesome adults—feel free to join your kiddos and
    tune in! Got questions or topic ideas for our chats? Shoot me an email—I'd
    love to hear from you!
