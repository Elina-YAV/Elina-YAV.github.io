<h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
    Young Able Voices serves as a safe place for kids that have hidden
    disabilities to connect with each other to share personal experienceses
    knowing they aren't alone and unheard.
</p>
<p>
    I know when I was younger I would have loved to have a place to come and
    chat with others that were experiencing similar challenges as I am. At
    first, I didn't mind being the only one with Childhood Apraxia of Speech, I
    kind of thought "Hey, this makes me unique." However, as I grew older I got
    more frustrated as my friends and family didn't understand what my struggle
    was like. No one understood how it felt to not be able to say what I wanted
    or when sounds that I had practiced hundreds of times came out wrong. It was
    terribly frustrating. It is my most sincere hope that Young Able Voices
    finds its way into children's lives and that it will make a very important
    difference for them.
</p>

<h2>How do we help?</h2>

<p>
    Living in an age where appearing perfect in school and on social media is
    everything, wouldn't it be super helpful to know that there is a safe place
    for kids to chat with others that are also struggling with hidden
    disabilities and are likely to understand how you feel?
</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
    My goal is to provide a place for kids that offers kind, age-appropriate
    conversation that will make each day a little bit easier and provide the
    knowledge that things will improve.

            Hi, I'm Elina! I'm an 18-year-old freshman at Rider University in
            NJ. When I'm not playing field hockey, golf or rock climbing, you'll
            find me diving into history books or engaging in community service.
            I'm part of Rider Gail Bierenbaum Leadership Council, Business
            honors program and the Baccalaureate Honors Program.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also hosted Gender Equity Matters Summits and participated in
            the MLK Leadership Summit, created a Hidden Disability Summit,
            spoken at the Apraxia Kids National Conference twice and have done a
            TEDX talk. Once that I'll be giving a TED talk in December 2023.
            Originally adopted from Khabarovsk, Russia, I'm passionate about
            helping others through Young Able Voices and can't wait to connect
            with new friends along the journey. Life has taught me that
            challenges are not roadblocks but stepping stones to something
            greater. I believe in the power of resilience, the beauty of
            diversity, and the endless possibilities that come from genuine
            connections. Let's inspire and uplift each other, one voice at a
            time.

            Hi everyone! My name is Maggie Peña, l am 18 years old, and I am a
            freshman psychology major at Rider University. I have a learning
            disability called Dyslexia, as well as Auditory Processing Disorder
            (APD). I was diagnosed with both Dyslexia and APD when I was 15, and
            I have accumulated many coping skills before and after my diagnosis.
            Some challenges I've faced are learning now to advocate for myself
            during my 3-year diagnosis process, figuring out how to verbalize
            what was going on, and catching up on learning Dyslexia-focused
            strategies while transitioning from high school to college. My goal
            with joining Young Able Voices is to supplement their advocacy and
            community by adding an additional perspective. If you or someone you
            know could benefit from peer-to-peer mentoring, then check out the
            resources available on this website! I can also be reached at

            provides.
